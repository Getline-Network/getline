 * Getline client library.

 * This library lets you view and manage Getline.in loans programatically.
 * It runs under node.js and in Chrome with the Metamask extension. You will
 * be automatically logged in as the first address from your web3 provider.
 *
 * The library is fully async/await compatible, which means you can use it
 * both with `Promise.then/.catch` and `await` blocks. All calls that interact
 * with the blockchain will block until the result propagates.
 *
 * Currently this library **only allows you to create loans on the Rinkeby
 * testnet** - this is by design until we go out of demo.
